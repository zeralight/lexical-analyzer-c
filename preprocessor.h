  Takes in a list of count files. For each file it parses the contents and
  extracts any files
  that are included with a #include PRAGMA. If the file is not already included
  for the
  particular file then it is searched. Collectively this produces a new list of
  files. These
  files are stored in the final_files pointer, which will be malloced inside
  ProcessIncludes.
  Includes are unique for each original file but not across mutliple files, so
  final_boundaries
  contains a list of count + 1 elements where elem i is the start index of
  files[i]'s group
  of files and i + 1 is the non inclusive end boundary. Final_boundaries is also
  malloced
  inside ProcessIncludes.
